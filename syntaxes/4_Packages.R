## Exercises -----
##===========================================================
# 1. In one of the earlier exercises (functionals) you have written a function
#   to calculate the statistical mode of a vector. Implement this function in 
#   your package. 

# 2. Document the function properly within the package and make sure it is
#   properly exported to the namespace. Add helpful examples to the documentation.


# 3. Open a new R session, install your package from Github and try to use your
#   function!

# 4. Create a testthat script and implement some automated tests for your new function.
